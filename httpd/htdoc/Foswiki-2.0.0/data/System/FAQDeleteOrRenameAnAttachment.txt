You can move and delete attachments directly from your browser. Moving lets you transfer an attachment from one topic to another. Delete moves an attachment to the special ==TrashAttachment== topic in the ==Trash== web, where it's hidden but can be "undeleted" with system administrator access.

%T% you cannot directly rename an attachment in the current Foswiki release, but you can move it to a different name in the same topic, effectively renaming it.

Different [[Skins][skins]] have different ways to do this. The default PatternSkin has a 'manage' link in the FileAttachment table, that then gives you the option to Delet the attachment.

%H% The configuration of your site and your own access permissions determine whether you can access these functions.

%H% *For system administrators*: To remove an attachment permanently move it to the Trash.<nop>TrashAttachment topic. If you are using one of the file-based stores, you can then delete the relevant files/directories manually from =pub/Trash/TrashAttachment=.
