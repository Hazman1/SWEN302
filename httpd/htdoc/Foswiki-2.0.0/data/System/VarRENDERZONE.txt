---+ RENDERZONE - render the content of a zone
Rendersa zone. See [[VarADDTOZONE][ADDTOZONE]] for an explanation of _zones_.

---++ Parameters
     %TABLE{sort="off"}%
     | *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
   | ="zone"= | name of the zone | | (reguired) |
   | =format=" | format string for each item added to the zone | <verbatim class="tml">$item <!--<literal> $id $missing</literal>--></verbatim> |
   | =missingtoken= | string assigned to the =$missing= format token for use in the =format= parameter. | \
   <verbatim class="tml">$id: requires= missing ids: $missingids</verbatim> |
   | =chomp= | remove leading and trailing whitespace from formatted items, can be useful for pretty-printing and compression. | =off= |
   | =header= | prepended to the output | |
   | =footer= | appended to the output | |
   | =separator= | put between each item of a zone | |
The following tokens are expanded in the =format= string:
      * =$id= - =id= of the [[VarADDTOZONE][ADDTOZONE]] call within the =zone= currently being rendered.
      * =$item= - text of the [[VarADDTOZONE][ADDTOZONE]] call within the =zone= currently being rendered.
      * =$zone= - the ="zone"= currently being rendered.
      * =$missing= - if the [[VarADDTOZONE][ADDTOZONE]] call being rendered required any =id= which was not found, then =$missing= is the =missingtoken= parameter; empty string otherwise.
      * =$missingids= - comma separated list of ids that were required by the [[VarADDTOZONE][ADDTOZONE]] call currently being rendered but weren't found within this =zone=.
Supports the [[FormatTokens][standard format tokens]] in all parameters.

<div class="foswikiHelp">
%H% =header= and =footer= are *not* output if there is no content in the
     zone (nothing has been =ADDTOZONEd= ). However they *are* output if the
     output is the empty string (at least one =ADDTOZONE= has been processed).

%H% Zones are cleared after being rendered; they are only ever rendered once.

%H% =head= and =script= are _automatic zones_. They don't require a
     corresponding =RENDERZONE= anywhere in the templates - they are
     automatically inserted before the =&lt;/head&gt;= tag in the output HTML
     page.

%H% Normally, dependencies between individual =ADDTOZONE= statements are
     resolved within each zone. However, if ={MergeHeadAndScriptZones}= is
     enabled in [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%][configure]], then =head=
     content which requires an =id= that only exists in =script= will be re-ordered 
     to satisfy this dependency. %X% ={MergeHeadAndScriptZones}= will be
     removed from a future version of Foswiki.
