---++ How to Find Your User Name

%MAKETEXT{"These steps may not be applicable to your system."}%

Look in %USERSWEB%.%WIKIUSERSTOPIC% - if your name is followed by a dash and a word, usually lowercase, this is what you log in with.

e.g.

   * !WikiGuest - guest - 05 Sep 2008

Would mean that !WikiGuest would log in using the username \'guest\'

If, on the other hand, if your entry is like this:

   * !WikiGuest - !WikiGuest 05 Sep 2008

Then you would log in using your WikiName, in this case \'WikiGuest\'
