---+ INCLUDINGWEB -- web that includes current topic
The web name of the topic that includes the current topic - same as =%<nop>WEB%= if there is no =INCLUDE=.
If a topic is used in a chain of =INCLUDEs=, =INCLUDINGWEB= is set to the topic directly INCLUDing this one, _NOT_ the web that has been requested by the user (which is given by =BASEWEB=)
   <div class="foswikiHelp">%X% Be careful of the subtle difference between =INCLUDINGWEB= and =BASEWEB=. You probably should be using =BASEWEB= </div>
