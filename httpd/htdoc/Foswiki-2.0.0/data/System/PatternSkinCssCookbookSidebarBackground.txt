---+!! PatternSkinCssCookbook Recipe: Sidebar background color
To see if the background color really extends beyond the body, we make the body contents longer than the sidebar.

Note that to set the background color, we set both =patternWrapper= and =patternSideBar=:
<verbatim class="css">
#patternWrapper,
#patternSideBar {
	background-color:#eee;
}
</verbatim>

<div class="foswikiHelp">
This line loads the extra style definition:
<verbatim class="tml">
   * Set USERSTYLEURL = %PUBURLPATH%/%SYSTEMWEB%/PatternSkinCssCookbookSidebarBackground/sidebar.css
</verbatim>
You can write this line in %SYSTEMWEB%.%WIKIPREFSTOPIC%, in %LOCALSITEPREFS%, in %WEBPREFSTOPIC%, in your user topic, or on a single page.
</div>
