---+ INCLUDINGTOPIC -- name of topic that includes current topic
The name of the topic that includes the current topic - same as =%<nop>TOPIC%= in case there is no include.
If a topic is used in a chain of =INCLUDEs=, =INCLUDINGTOPIC= is set to the topic directly INCLUDing this one, _NOT_ the topic that has been requested by the user (which is given by =BASETOPIC=)
   <div class="foswikiHelp">%X% Be careful of the subtle difference between =INCLUDINGTOPIC= and =BASETOPIC=. You probably should be using =BASETOPIC= </div>
