---+ FORMFIELD -- renders a field in the form attached to some topic
---++ Parameters
     %TABLE{sort="off"}%
     | *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
     | ="name"= | The name of a [[DataForms][Data form]] field | |
     | =topic="..."= | Topic where form data is located. May be of the form =Web.<nop>TopicName= | Current topic |
     | =format= | Format string. See Tokens expanded in =format= below. | =$value= |
     | =default= | Text shown if the field is defined in the topic, but the field value is empty. For example, a text field for which all the content has been deleted. | |
     | =alttext= | Text shown if the field is not defined in the topic (even if it is specified in the form definition). For example, this is used when a field exists in the form definition, but the referring topic hasn't been edited since it was added. | |
     | =rev="n"= | Specify a revision of the topic. If not specified, defaults to the most recent rev (or the viewed rev if viewing an old rev of the same topic) | |
Tokens expanded in =format=:
   * =$value= expands to the *raw* field value
   * =$value(display)= is the form field value _after_ mapping the stored value to the display value (use with =+values= form fields). If the field type does not support value mapping, renders the same as =$value=
   * =$name= is the field name
   * =$title= expands to the field title
   * =$formname= gives the name of the form the field is in. =$form= is maintained for compatibility, but is deprecated
   * =$attributes= - from the field definition
   * =$type= - from the field definition
   * =$size= - from the field definition
   * =$definingTopic= - topic in which the field is defined
   * The [[FormatTokens][standard format tokens]] are also expanded
