---+ COVER -- current skin cover
Extends the skin search path. For instance, if [[VarSKIN][SKIN]] is set to =catskin, bearskin=, and =COVER= is set to =ruskin=, the skin search path becomes =ruskin, catskin, bearskin=.

The =COVER= setting can be overridden using the URL parameter =cover=, such as =?cover=ruskin=
---++ Examples
   * =%<nop>COVER%= currently expands to =%COVER%= (it will only expand when a cover is actually set)
